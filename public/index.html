<!-- load the jquery library. jquery is a javascript library that is essentially shorthand for js
when you see the $ in javascript, that means you're working with jquery -->

<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js"></script>

<!-- Here's a button. 
When you click it, it runs the "getTemp" function -->
Click my button
<button type="button" onclick="getTemp()">Click Me!</button><br>

<!-- This is just a text area that changes with javascript... see below  -->
Here's my result:
<span id="result"></span>

<!-- This script tag means I'm including javascript in my html.
This is where I'm storing my getTemp function
When someone hits my button, it makes an ajax call to the open weather map api
The $$$ means that we're using jquery
We could do this with "vanilla javascript" but jquery makes it all a lot quicker/easier -->

<script type="text/javascript">

// Here's my function that runs when the button is clicked
function getTemp() {

  // I'm just logging here to make sure my code is running when I think it should
  console.log('Getting temp');
  
  // This line that is commented out is what I would use if I wanted the code below to run once the page loaded
  //$(document).ready(function(){

    // All of this stuff is sent to open weather map, including the two functions for "success" and "error" or failure

    $.ajax({
      url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?id=5128581&units=imperial&APPID=90051f65edc86dcffa5f4cdf9dbff9f7",
      dataType: 'json',
      success: function(data) {
        console.log("success", data.main.temp);
        //alert("Temperature is: " + data.main.temp );

        // This displays the weather result if there is one.
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = data.main.temp;
      },
      error: function() {

        // This opens an error window if there's an error
        alert("error");
        
      }
    });        
  };
</script>
